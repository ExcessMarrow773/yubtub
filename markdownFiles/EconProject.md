## Our opinion on Unemployment Insurance

I think unemployment insurance is effective but could be better, because unemployment insurance helps people a lot economically because there are people that need that help when they lose their job, and is effective because it serves the purpose of helping people. But I think that it could use more resources to help people that need it, including helping people find affordable housing and food. Here are some [ways Unemployment Insurance could be better](https://www.nelp.org/insights-research/boosting-economic-resilience-seven-ways-states-can-support-more-workers-with-unemployment-insurance/), including, expanding eligibility and better information from employers about applying for unemployment insurance benefits.
